Also known as Benares, Banaras, or Kashi, Varanasi is claimed to be one of the oldest livelihood cities in the world.

A famous American writer, Mark Twain once penned down that “ ‘Benares is older than history, older than tradition, older even than legend, and looks twice as old as all of them put together.
Once you’re in Varanasi, you’ll experience crowd and queue, temples everywhere, old traditional buildings, narrow lanes, cows, etc and that’s the beauty of Varanasi.
The trip to Varanasi is incomplete if you do not attend the Ganga aarti performed by priests at the Ghats which looks immensely beautiful.</P>
